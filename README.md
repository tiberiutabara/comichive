### The designing process

The first step in building the website was designing it in Figma, which is always my go-to approach when creating a fully customized e-commerce store without using a template. Starting with a well-structured design ensures that the final product aligns with the brand identity and user expectations. To establish the overall aesthetic and tone, I created a style guide that included the color palette, typography (font styles and sizes), button designs in all states, and commonly used UI elements. Additionally, I included reference images to maintain consistency and designed a dark background version to enhance accessibility and user preference options.

From the start, I prioritized mobile optimization, ensuring that every page was designed for both desktop and mobile to provide a seamless user experience across devices. By following fundamental UX principles, I structured the design to be intuitive and user-friendly. Elements were repeated in a logical, predictable manner to enhance familiarity, such as maintaining alignment across sections and designing product boxes that resembled collection boxes while still maintaining distinct characteristics. The use of color was also strategic, drawing attention to key areas in a hierarchy of importance. The layout was designed to be accessible and familiar, ensuring ease of navigation while also introducing creative touches that set the website apart.

### Functionalities and features

The homepage includes a carousel hero section to highlight key visuals, followed by four featured products strategically placed to showcase bestsellers or new arrivals. A dedicated text block incorporates an image along with primary and secondary buttons, offering multiple call-to-action options. To create variation in the layout, the newsletter section was designed with a unique background and reversed text alignment. Additionally, three articles were featured on the homepage, while a separate blog page was developed to house all published content in an organized format. These sections were structured for clear navigation and efficient content management, ensuring smooth updates and an optimized user experience.

The design is fully responsive, ensuring smooth adaptation across all screen sizes and devices. Animations were implemented for a better user experience by adding fluidity without affecting performance. The product page was fully customized having specific elements added to it. All custom sections were coded using Liquid schemas, allowing for modular updates without additional development work. Additionally, reusable snippets, such as buttons with multiple style variantsâ€” including primary, secondary, and versions for both light and dark backgrounds were implemented to maintain design consistency and improve maintainability across different sections of the site.
